This is my first project. 
It's a web portfolio for all of the skills that I have. 
Although I consider that speaking 3 to 4 languages are also valuable
skills to have, my main focus will be my film and editing skills,
(as well as my Television experience), my graphic design skills and 
my programming skills, which so far is just this site. 

Main image: My graduation photo is iconic to me, I think that the black 
and white is nice, and I decided to turn the background into black, so
there is somewhat of a transition from my toga to the rest of the page.

Text over the image: I'm currently working on this, I want to give it 
an effect where the text, gets distorted with the image under it, 
without sacrificing readability. I'm not sure what the effect is called
but it's definitely some kind of distort effect.

Intro paragraph: I just wrote some brief info, I want to centralize 
the text but I'm having a difficult time doing so, that leads me to:

Social media footer: I'm also trying to centralize the two icons that I've 
put at the bottom, but I don't knnow if the code I need is different than that
for text.

Other things: I'm still working on all three of my portfolios, so far
I'm just making this so that I can practice my HTML, CSS and eventually, JavaScript, 
skills. I'm going to be adding stuff to my graphic design space but
I don't know how to add stuff that I've done on my computer
without having uploaded the material to the internet. I'm not sure
if that can be done, so I'll keep searching for the answer.

That's it for now, if anybody comes across this and would like to make any suggestions as well,
I'm all ears.
